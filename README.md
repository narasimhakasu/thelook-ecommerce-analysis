## 📊 Dashboard Pages
Explore the full interactive dashboard here:  
👉 [TheLook E-Commerce Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/m2vkZuDORB4)

The dashboard is divided into 4 pages:

1. **Business Overview** → Revenue, profit, orders, order stages  
2. **Product Insights** → Revenue by category, top products, monthly product revenue  
3. **Customer Insights** → Demographics, repeat customers, age buckets  
4. **Distribution & Operations** → Revenue & orders by distribution centers, operational metrics  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Revenue is strongly driven by **Men’s category**, followed by **Women’s**.  
- **Repeat customers** form a significant share of revenue growth.  
- Older age groups **(55+) dominate** purchases.  
- Distribution centers vary in performance, highlighting opportunities for **logistics optimization**.  

---

## 🚀 How to Reproduce
1. Connect to **BigQuery public dataset**: `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce`  
2. Run the queries from [`sql_queries/`](sql_queries/) to create staging and summary tables.  
3. Import summary tables into **Looker Studio**.  
4. Rebuild dashboard pages using charts, tables, and filters.  
5. Compare insights with documentation in [`docs/`](docs/).  

---

## 📈 Recommendations
- Improve **repeat customer retention strategies** (loyalty programs).  
- Optimize **distribution center load balancing**.  
- Focus on **high-revenue categories** while reducing underperforming products.  
- Leverage **age bucket segmentation** for targeted marketing.
